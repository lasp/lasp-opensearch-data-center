# Ingest Processing Construct Usage

The Ingest Processing Construct contains resources uses to orchestrate ingestion of data files into OpenSearch. 
The actual processing code must be supplied in the form Lambda functions: Dropbox Lambda and Ingest Lambda.

## Components

- Orchestration Queues that pass S3 creation events from the Dropbox Bucket and Ingest Bucket to their respective
  Lambda functions. These functions are provided with a standard set of environment variables (see `constants.py`).
- Ingest Status Table which can be used to keep track of ingest status, using the functions provided in 
  `ingest_status.py` for interacting with DynamoDB (or you can write your own DDB code in your Lambda).
- Optional backup plan for Ingest Status Table (if backup_vault is provided)

# Example Usage in Stack
