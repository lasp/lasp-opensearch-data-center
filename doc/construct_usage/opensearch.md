# OpenSearch Construct Usage

The OpenSearch Construct contains all the architecture required for deploying an OpenSearch cluster. It requires 
some configuration as input (construct arguments) for elements of the architecture that are judged to be 
the responsibility of the user implementing a CDK application (e.g. a data center).

## Components

- OpenSearch Domain (cluster and nodes), with attached access policy for configured IP range
- Lambda function for taking snapshots of opensearch indexes, scheduled to run daily

# Example Usage in Stack

```python
"""Example Stack for OpenSearch deployment using our OpenSearchConstruct"""
